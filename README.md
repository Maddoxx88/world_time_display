# Worldtime Display 🕰️

*A new Flutter application using World Time API* 

## 🎯 Motto 

This application displays time and city according to the user's selection which is the base version made by [NetNinja](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/flutter-beginners-tutorial). However here I have displayed backgrounds according to the city selected by the user and also the backgrounds are distinct for day time and night time **(which is past 20:00)**

## 🔺 Scale

Although the current cities, URLs, and images and statically included as a list to display this can further be done by using a cloud storage combined with a database to make it completely dynamic.
